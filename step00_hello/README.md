If you are getting an error:

curl: (1) Protocol "http" not supported or disabled in libcurl on Mac OS

[Read the issue we created, and the solution](https://github.com/dfinity/docs/issues/574)

Download Keysmith and dfx give the following commands:

 tar -f keysmith-*.tar* -x

 tar -f dfx-*.tar* -x

sudo install -d /usr/local/bin

sudo install keysmith /usr/local/bin

sudo install -d /usr/local/bin

sudo install dfx /usr/local/bin

 If you are using macOS, making the keysmith binary executable might require you to change a permission setting using System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General.

 dfx --version

 dfx upgrade

 dfx new step00_hello

 Open a new second terminal window or tab on your local computer.

 cd step00_hello

 dfx start

 Leave the terminal window that displays network operations open and switch your focus to the first terminal window where you created your new project.

 npm install

 dfx deploy

 dfx canister call step00_hello greet zia

Now lets test the front-end:

npm start

Open a browser.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/

To stop the local network:

In the terminal that displays development server, press Control-C to interrupt the development server process.

In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

Stop the local Internet Computer network running on your local computer by running the following command:

dfx stop


# step00_hello

Welcome to your new step00_hello project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with step00_hello, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/sdk-guide.html)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/language-manual.html)
- [JavaScript API Reference](https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.ic0.app)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd step00_hello/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
